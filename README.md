User can create as many Hotels as needed.

User can create as many rooms belonging to each of the Hotels as needed.

Once a user has rooms that belong to a Hotel, they can start making reservations on individual rooms. The system sends an email to the user once they make a reservation confirming the Hotel name and the Room name.

A User cannot book a room when it is occupied.

The user can also cancel reservations and an email is sent to notify the user of the cancellations.

Clicking on the Rooms link in the Navbar shows all the rooms, but when a user clicks on the Hotel and then clicks the Show Available rooms, the rooms that belong to the Hotel are only shown.

A User can only view their own reservations.

A User needs to signup and sign in to make more Hotels and Rooms.
